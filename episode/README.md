# Episode Directory

This directory contains GraphQL queries to retrieve details about specific episodes from the Rick and Morty API.

## Queries

1. **episode-page-1.graphql**  
   A GraphQL query to retrieve details about episodes (page 1).  
   The query fetches the following fields:  
   - `id`  
   - `name`  
   - `air_date`  
   - `episode`  

## Output Files

Each of the `.graphql` query files has a corresponding output file in JSON format:

  The output contains the results for episodes retrieved from page 1 of the query.

Additional queries for other pages, such as page 2, 3, and 4, are structured in a similar manner and can be found under the `characters` directory.
